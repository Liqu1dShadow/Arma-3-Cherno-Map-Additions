# Arma-3-Cherno-Map-Additions
Multiple map additions I have made for Cherno on Arma 3

You can see them here

I didn’t make the delivery method for the map additions (the PBO structure), I can’t remember who made that (if someone can let me know I’ll credit them) but the map additions are all mine with 100% of the work created by myself.

It’s a sad day that my server lost all its players very quickly and has given me a reason to release these files as I no longer want to run the server. There is hundreds of hours’ worth of work in these and I ask that you leave the credits in the files and credit my work where required please. It’s painful to release but I see no benefit in keeping these for my server only so there is some joy in the fact more people will get to play on them.

Files,
11 Outposts
- 11 small single military tower outposts with barriers all over the map, there is on south of Berizeno (or however it’s spelt) if you want to look

Balota Boat Yard
- Something different, it’s a boat scrap yard, I covered the ATC so it didn’t look like a runway

Cherno Buildings with Military Base
- Extra lootable buildings, houses, industrial, offices ect and a military base next to the hotel

Devil Castle Slums
- Big collection of slums and general mess, scrap cars and litter, Atmospheric

Green Mountain 
- Small addition to Green Mountain to make it a little tricky to get in and out with a military building to loot. Was made so players could make a base up there

Hill Top View
- Slums on the mountain between Cherno and Electro, a slum going down the back of the hill

Komarovo
- New Buildings, slums, and a hospital to the East

Lost Hope Base
- A big base to the north of the map, a couple of clicks NE of the NWAF in the clearing

NEAF Base
- Massive Base with industrial, military buildings

NWAF Base
- Large base on the north of the run way

NWAF Extra Stuff
- Extra Hangers and an airport terminal 

Scrap Yard 1
- Very cool scrap yard at Bash

Scrap Yard 2
- The same scrap yard with a few changes on the coast road between Cherno and Elektro

Skalisty Bridge
- A simple bridge with 4 buildings (military) 


You put this in your @EpochHive/Addons folder and that's it, it will just run. You can unpack the PBO and take out what you don't want or just copy it into an existing PBO.
